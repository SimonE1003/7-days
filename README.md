## Application description:

This application is a text-based game called "Seven Days", where the player tries to survive for 7 days in a post-apocalyptic world. The game features day and night, where players can visit places like a supermarket or a weapon shop during the day, but they must stay in the shelter at night. These maps (such as supermarkets) will contain story points where the player can trigger relevant events and receive rewards or punishments. At night, random (and weird) things will happen. The path of the story is primarily dictated by the player's choice, leading to rewards, punishments, or both. After each night, the player will have to consume some food and water; otherwise, or else bad things will happen.

The player has status indicators including health, hunger, thirst, and sanity, as well as an item list that includes food, water, bullets, and more. These will be crucial during gameplay, and the boss fight after seven days of survival. 

If the player is not dead within seven-days, he/she will enter the final boss fight, and win if the boss is defeated.
